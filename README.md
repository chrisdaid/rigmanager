# Crypto Mining Rig Manager
<b><i>(Work in progress)</i></b>
<br>

The goal of this project is to be able to manage cryptocurrency mining systems and monitor hashrate in one single place. Currently, it is a paid feature for users of HiveOS to have multiple computers on one account, so users have two choices: pay Hive, or have multiple accounts (which is time consuming and clunky). Additionally, users must visit another website to monitor the "real" hashrate, or rate at which they are mining as opposed to trusting what the miner says they are outputting. 

At first, only Ethermine and Flexpool will be supported, but as time goes on, more pools will be supported.

features: 
- Add multiple rigs with different eth addresses
- Supports multiple pools
- Display current gas price on Ethereum Network
- Display BTC, ETH, and BNB prices
